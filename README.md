TRAINS Agent is an AI experiment cluster solution.

It is a zero configuration fire-and-forget execution agent and combined with trains-server it is a full AI cluster solution.

**Using the TRAINS Agent, you can now setup a dynamic cluster with only two lines!**

## Simple, Flexible Experiment Orchestration
**The TRAINS Agent was built to address the DL/ML R&D DevOps needs:**

* Easily add & remove machines from the cluster
* Reuse machines without the need for any dedicated containers or images
* **Combine on-prem GPU resources with any cloud GPU resources**
* **No need for yaml/json/template configuration of any kind**
* **User friendly UI**
* Manageable resource allocation that can be used by researchers and engineers
* Flexible and controllable scheduler with priority support
* Automatic instance spinning in the cloud **(coming soon)**

### Integrating with Kubernetes 
K8S is awesome. It is a great tool and combined with KubeFlow it's a robust solution for production. Let us stress that point again - *"For Production"*.
It was never designed to help or facilitate R&D efforts of DL/ML. Having to package every experiment in a docker, managing those hundreds (or more) containers and building pipelines on top of it all is complicated (itâ€™s usually out of scope for the research team, and overwhelming even for the DevOps team).

We feel there has to be a better way, that can be just as powerful for R&D and at the same time allow integration with K8S **when the need arises**. If you already have a K8S cluster for AI, detailed instructions on how to integrate TRAINS into your K8S cluster is *coming soon*.


## Using the TRAINS Agent
**Full scale HPC with a click of a button**

TRAINS Agent is a job scheduler that listens on job queue(s), pulls jobs, sets the job environments, executes the job and monitors its progress.

Any 'Draft' experiment can be scheduled for execution by a TRAINS agent.

A previously run experiment can be put into 'Draft' state by either of two methods:
* Using the **'Reset'** action from the experiment right-click context menu in the
  TRAINS UI - This will clear any results and artifacts the previous run had created.
* Using the **'Clone'** action from the experiment right-click context menu in the
  TRAINS UI - This will create a new 'Draft' experiment with the same configuration as the original experiment.

An experiment is scheduled for execution using the **'Enqueue'** action from the experiment
 right-click context menu in the TRAINS UI and selecting the execution queue.
 
See [creating an experiment, and enqueuing it for execution](#from-scratch).

Once an experiment is enqueued, it will be picked up and executed by a TRAINS agent monitoring this queue.

The TRAINS UI Workers & Queues page provides ongoing execution information:
  - Workers Tab: Monitor you cluster
    - Review available resources
    - Monitor machines statistics (CPU / GPU / Disk / Network)
  - Queues Tab: 
    - Control the scheduling order of jobs
    - Cancel or abort job execution
    - Move jobs between execution queues

### What The TRAINS Agent Actually Does
The TRAINS agent executes experiments using the following process:
  - Create a new virtual environment (or launch the selected docker image)
  - Clone the code into the virtual-environment (or inside the docker)
  - Install python packages based on the package requirements listed for the experiment
    - Special note for PyTorch, The TRAINS agent will automatically select the 
      torch packages based on the CUDA_VERSION environment of the machine
  - Execute the code, while monitoring the process
  - Log all stdout/stderr in the TRAINS UI, including the cloning and installation process, for easy debugging
  - Monitor the execution and allow you to manually abort the job using the TRAINS UI (or, in the unfortunate case of a code crash, catch the error and signal the experiment has failed)

```

### Installing the TRAINS Agent

```bash
pip install trains_agent
```

### TRAINS Agent Usage Examples

Full Interface and capabilities are available with
```bash
trains-agent --help
trains-agent daemon --help
```

### Configuring the TRAINS Agent

```bash
trains-agent init
```

Note: The TRAINS agent uses a cache folder to cache pip packages, apt packages and cloned repositories. The default TRAINS Agent cache folder is `~/.trains`

See full details in your configuration file at `~/trains.conf`

Note: The **TRAINS agent** extends the **TRAINS** configuration file `~/trains.conf`
They are designed to share the same configuration file, see example [here](docs/trains.conf)

### Running the TRAINS Agent

For debug and experimentation, start the TRAINS agent in `foreground` mode, where all the output is printed to screen
```bash
trains-agent daemon --queue default --foreground
```

For actual service mode, all the stdout will be stored automatically into a temporary file (no need to pipe)
```bash
trains-agent daemon --queue default
```

#### Starting the TRAINS Agent in docker mode

For debug and experimentation, start the TRAINS agent in `foreground` mode, where all the output is printed to screen
```bash
trains-agent daemon --queue default --docker --foreground
```

For actual service mode, all the stdout will be stored automatically into a file (no need to pipe)
```bash
trains-agent daemon --queue default --docker
```

#### Starting the TRAINS Agent - Priority Queues

Priority Queues are also supported, example use case: 

High priority queue: `important_jobs`  Low priority queue: `default`
```bash
trains-agent daemon --queue important_jobs default
```
The **TRAINS agent** will first try to pull jobs from the `important_jobs` queue, only then it will fetch a job from the `default` queue.

# AutoML and Orchestration Pipelines <a name="automl-pipes"></a>
The TRAINS Agent can also implement AutoML orchestration and Experiment Pipelines in conjunction with the TRAINS package.

Sample AutoML & Orchestration examples can be found in the TRAINS [example/automl](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/tree/master/examples/automl) folder.

AutoML examples
  - [Toy Keras training experiment](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/automl/automl_base_template_keras_simple.py)
    - In order to create an experiment-template in the system, this code must be executed once manually 
  - [Random Search over the above Keras experiment-template](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/automl/automl_random_search_example.py)
    - This example will create multiple copies of the Keras experiment-template, with different hyper-parameter combinations

Experiment Pipeline examples
  - [First step experiment](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/automl/task_piping_example.py)
    - This example will "process data", and once done, will launch a copy of the 'second step' experiment-template
  - [Second step experiment](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/automl/toy_base_task.py)
    - In order to create an experiment-template in the system, this code must be executed once manually
     
 # How do I create an experiment on the TRAINS server? <a name="from-scratch"></a>
* Integrate [TRAINS](https://github.com/allegroai/trains) with your code
* Execute the code on your machine (Manually / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook)
* As your code is running, **TRAINS** creates an experiment logging all the necessary execution information:
  - Git repository link and commit ID (or an entire jupyter notebook)
  - Git diff (weâ€™re not saying you never commit and push, but still...)
  - Python packages used by your code (including specific versions used)
  - Hyper-Parameters
  - Input Artifacts
  
  You now have a 'template' of your experiment with everything required for automated execution
  
* In the TRAINS UI, Right click on the experiment and select 'clone'. A copy of your experiment will be created.
* You now have a new draft experiment cloned from your original experiment, feel free to edit it
  - Change the Hyper-Parameters
  - Switch to the latest code base of the repository
  - Update package versions
  - Select a specific docker image to run in (see docker execution mode section)
  - Or simply change nothing to run the same experiment again...
* Send the newly created experiment for execution, right-click the experiment and select 'enqueue'
